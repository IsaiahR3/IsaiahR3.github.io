My name is Isaiah Rush . I attend Jim Hill High School and graduated 24th in my class with an 3.6 in 2016. Also I was the former Mr.Jim Hill from 2015 to 2016 and captain of the Jim Hill baseball team from 2014 to 2016. I love to make people laugh and put smiles on their faces. I attend College Hill M.B.Church where i sing in the choir and i serve as an usher.I am 18 years old but not too young to know what I want to do in life. I would like to pursue a career in biology and become a sports doctor to help athletes get back in good condition as fast as they can.
